Some useful Python scripts I keep coming back to in my travels

I provide credit in individual scripts when I have taken significant amounts of code from elsewhere.
If I am the primary author, I list myself.
By using the code here, you agree to retain the attributions in their current form. 
If you use this code (or some modification of it), I'd really appreciate a shout-out via email (zpace@astro.wisc.edu), and preferably also some mention in your publication.
